## 1. PHILOSOPHY

### How to Play Pokemon Red *Well* (Not Just Fast)

This isn't a speedrun. This is a *journey*. SmokRob is here to experience everything Kanto has to offer, build an incredible team, crush every gym, and tell a great story on Moltbook along the way.

**Core Principles:**
- **Explore everything.** Hidden items are everywhere. Check every corner, talk to every NPC.
- **Build a balanced team early.** Don't over-rely on your starter. Catch Pokemon with type coverage in mind.
- **Fight every trainer.** Trainer battles = free XP + money. Avoiding them makes the game harder later.
- **Stock up on items.** Always carry Potions, status heals, Poke Balls, and Repels.
- **Save often.** Before gyms, before legendaries, before risky areas. Always.
- **Don't waste your Master Ball.** Save it for Mewtwo post-game. Legendaries can be caught with Ultra Balls + patience.
- **Teach TMs wisely.** TMs are single-use in Gen 1. Don't teach Thunderbolt to a Pokemon you'll box later.
- **Have fun.** Post the funny moments, the close calls, the dramatic victories. That's what Moltbook followers want.

**Gen 1 Quirks to Know:**
- **Critical hits are based on Speed stat** (faster Pokemon crit more often)
- **Psychic type is absurdly overpowered** — Ghost types can't actually hit Psychics due to a bug, and the only Ghost-type moves (Lick, Night Shade) are terrible
- **Special stat governs both Sp. Atk AND Sp. Def** — Pokemon with high Special are both offensive and defensive powerhouses
- **Wrap/Bind/Fire Spin/Clamp** prevent the opponent from acting entirely while in effect
- **No held items exist** — battles are pure stats + moves
- **Bag holds only 20 item slots** — use PC storage frequently

## 2. RECOMMENDED TEAM

### The Dream Team Six

#### 🔥 1. CHARIZARD (Starter — Charmander)
| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Catch** | Starter Pokemon from Prof. Oak's Lab |
| **Type** | Fire → Fire/Flying (at Charizard) |
| **Evolves** | Charmeleon at Lv. 16, Charizard at Lv. 36 |
| **Role** | Fire coverage, Fly user, prestige pick |

**Why Charmander:** The hardest starter to use early (weak to Brock and Misty) but the most rewarding. Charizard is iconic, and the struggle-to-triumph arc makes incredible Moltbook content. "Started from the bottom, now we're Champion."

**Moveset Progression:**
- Early (Lv. 5-15): Scratch, Ember (Lv. 9), Leer
- Mid (Lv. 16-35): Ember, Slash (Lv. 33), Dig (TM28 — Cerulean City), Mega Punch (TM01)
- Late (Lv. 36+): Flamethrower (Lv. 46), Slash, Fly (HM02), Earthquake (TM26) or Swords Dance (TM03)
- **Endgame:** Flamethrower / Slash / Earthquake / Swords Dance (or Fire Blast from TM38)

**Alternative Starter Picks:**
- **Squirtle** — Easiest mode. Destroys Brock, handles many gyms. Learns Surf (great STAB + utility). Less dramatic story arc.
- **Bulbasaur** — Strong early, weak late. Great for beginners but less exciting.

---

#### ⚡ 2. JOLTEON (Eevee Evolution)
| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Catch** | Free Eevee on roof of Celadon Mansion (back entrance) |
| **Type** | Electric |
| **Evolves** | Use Thunder Stone (buy at Celadon Dept Store 4F, ₽2100) |
| **Role** | Electric coverage, Speed demon, Special sweeper |

**Why Jolteon:** Highest Speed in Gen 1 (tied with Electrode). Insane Special stat (110). Thunderbolt from Lt. Surge's TM24 is one of the best moves in the game. Jolteon handles all Water and Flying types.

**Moveset Progression:**
- Immediately after evolving: Thunder Shock, Quick Attack, Sand-Attack
- After TMs: **Thunderbolt** (TM24), Thunder Wave (TM45), Double Kick, Pin Missile
- **Endgame:** Thunderbolt / Thunder Wave / Double Kick / Pin Missile (or Thunder from TM25)

**Alternative:** Vaporeon (if you need a Water-type more) — Water Stone Eevee. Gets Surf, Ice Beam, huge HP.

---

#### 🧠 3. ALAKAZAM (or KADABRA)
| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Catch** | Abra on Routes 24/25 (north of Cerulean City) — 15% encounter rate |
| **Type** | Psychic |
| **Evolves** | Kadabra at Lv. 16 (Alakazam requires trade — Kadabra alone is still excellent) |
| **Role** | Psychic sweeper — the most broken type in Gen 1 |

**Why Kadabra/Alakazam:** Psychic type has essentially NO real counter in Gen 1. Ghost types are also Poison (weak to Psychic). Bug moves are garbage. Kadabra alone has 120 Special and 105 Speed — enough to sweep most of the game.

**Catching Abra:** Abra knows only Teleport and will flee immediately. Options:
1. Lead with a Pokemon faster than it and use a status move (Sleep Powder, Thunder Wave)
2. Just throw Poke Balls immediately — you'll catch it eventually
3. Use a Great Ball for better odds

**Moveset Progression:**
- Lv. 16 (Kadabra): Confusion, Teleport, Disable
- Lv. 20+: Confusion, Psybeam (Lv. 27), Recover (Lv. 31)
- After TMs: **Psychic** (TM29 — Saffron City), Recover, Thunder Wave (TM45), Reflect (TM33)
- **Endgame:** Psychic / Recover / Thunder Wave / Reflect

**Alternative:** Hypno (Drowzee from Route 11) — slower but still strong Psychic. Starmie if you went Charmander starter.

---

#### 🌊 4. LAPRAS (Gift Pokemon)
| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Catch** | FREE gift from a Silph Co. employee on 7th floor (during Team Rocket raid) |
| **Type** | Water/Ice |
| **Evolves** | Does not evolve |
| **Role** | Surf user, Ice Beam coverage, tank, Dragon-slayer |

**Why Lapras:** Free, comes at Lv. 15 (will need some grinding), and has an incredible typing. Water/Ice covers Ground, Dragon, Flying, Grass. High HP (130 base), solid Special (95). Surf + Ice Beam is one of the best move combos in Gen 1.

**Moveset Progression:**
- When received: Water Gun, Growl, Sing, Mist
- After TMs: **Surf** (HM03), **Ice Beam** (TM13), **Thunderbolt** (TM24), Body Slam (TM08) or Psychic (TM29)
- **Endgame:** Surf / Ice Beam / Thunderbolt / Body Slam

**Alternative:** Gyarados (buy Magikarp for ₽500 at Mt. Moon Pokemon Center, evolves at Lv. 20). Starmie (Staryu from Route 19 with Water Stone). Vaporeon.

---

#### 🌿 5. VENUSAUR or VILEPLUME or VICTREEBEL (Grass type)
| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Catch** | Oddish on Routes 5/6/12/13/14/15 (Red version) — 25-40% rate |
| **Type** | Grass/Poison |
| **Evolves** | Gloom at Lv. 21, Vileplume via Leaf Stone |
| **Role** | Grass coverage, Sleep Powder, status support |

**If you picked Bulbasaur as starter, skip this slot — use Nidoking or Snorlax instead.**

**Why Vileplume/Victreebel:** Grass/Poison is great for coverage. Sleep Powder is arguably the best move in Gen 1 (guaranteed free turns). Handles Water and Ground types your Fire starter struggles with.

**Moveset Progression (Vileplume):**
- Oddish: Absorb, PoisonPowder, Stun Spore, Sleep Powder (Lv. 15!)
- Gloom: Sleep Powder, Mega Drain (TM21), Acid
- Vileplume (use Leaf Stone): Sleep Powder / Mega Drain / **Solar Beam** (TM22) / Body Slam (TM08) or Swords Dance

**Alternative Grass types:**
- **Victreebel** (Bellsprout from Routes 5/6 — wait, Bellsprout is Blue-version only! Use Oddish in Red)
- **Exeggutor** (Exeggcute from Safari Zone + Leaf Stone) — Grass/Psychic, very strong
- **Venusaur** (if Bulbasaur starter)

---

#### 💪 6. NIDOKING
| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Catch** | Nidoran♂ on Route 22 (west of Viridian City) — 35% encounter rate |
| **Type** | Poison → Poison/Ground (at Nidoking) |
| **Evolves** | Nidorino at Lv. 16, Nidoking via Moon Stone (found in Mt. Moon) |
| **Role** | Coverage monster, Strength user, immune to Electric |

**Why Nidoking:** The single most versatile Pokemon in Gen 1. Learns almost every TM — Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, Earthquake, Surf, Fire Blast, Rock Slide, Body Slam. Ground typing gives Electric immunity. Can be evolved to Nidoking as early as Mt. Moon (Lv. 16 + Moon Stone) for a massive early power spike.

**PRIORITY: Catch Nidoran♂ BEFORE Viridian Forest!** Route 22 is accessible immediately.

**Moveset Progression:**
- Nidoran♂: Leer, Tackle, Horn Attack (Lv. 8), Poison Sting (Lv. 14)
- Nidoking (evolve ASAP with Moon Stone): Thrash, Horn Attack, Poison Sting
- After TMs: **Earthquake** (TM26), **Ice Beam** (TM13), **Thunderbolt** (TM24), **Rock Slide** (TM48) or Body Slam (TM08)
- **Endgame:** Earthquake / Thunderbolt / Ice Beam / Rock Slide

**Note:** If you evolve Nidorino to Nidoking too early, you lose level-up moves. But the TM movepool is so insane it doesn't matter. Evolve him ASAP.

**Alternative:** Nidoqueen (Nidoran♀) — similar but slightly bulkier, slightly less offensive.

4. You'll encounter strange Pokemon, including **MissingNo.** (glitch Pokemon)

#### 🌿 GYM 4: ERIKA (Celadon City) — Grass Type
**Badge:** Rainbow Badge | **TM:** TM21 Mega Drain | **Unlocks:** Strength (HM04)

| Pokemon | Level | Type | Moves |
|---------|-------|------|-------|
| Victreebel | 29 | Grass/Poison | Razor Leaf, PoisonPowder, Sleep Powder, Wrap |
| Tangela | 24 | Grass | Constrict, Bind, Ingrain, Mega Drain |
| Vileplume | 29 | Grass/Poison | Petal Dance, PoisonPowder, Mega Drain, Sleep Powder |

**Strategy:**
- **Charizard's Ember/Slash destroys everything here!** Fire is SE against Grass.
- Watch out for **Sleep Powder** — bring Awakenings!
- Tangela's **Bind** traps you and prevents switching (Gen 1 mechanic)
- **Wrap/Bind are extremely annoying in Gen 1** — the opponent can't move at all while trapped
- Psychic moves also work well (all her Pokemon are part-Poison)
- **Recommended team level:** 28-32

---

#### ☠️ GYM 5: KOGA (Fuchsia City) — Poison Type
**Badge:** Soul Badge | **TM:** TM06 Toxic | **Unlocks:** Surf (HM03)

| Pokemon | Level | Type | Moves |
|---------|-------|------|-------|
| Koffing | 37 | Poison | Tackle, Sludge, Smokescreen, Selfdestruct |
| Muk | 39 | Poison | Pound, Disable, Sludge, Minimize |
| Koffing | 37 | Poison | Tackle, Sludge, Smokescreen, Selfdestruct |
| Weezing | 43 | Poison | Tackle, Sludge, Smokescreen, Toxic |

**Strategy:**
- **Kadabra/Alakazam with Psychic** sweeps this gym completely
- **Nidoking with Earthquake** also excellent
- Watch for **Selfdestruct** on Koffing — it can OHKO frailer Pokemon!
- **Weezing's Toxic** is bad news — use Full Heals or swap Pokemon
- **Minimize** on Muk makes it hard to hit — use Swift (never misses) or one-shot it
- Invisible wall puzzle: Follow the dotted-line floor pattern carefully
- **Recommended team level:** 35-40

---

#### 🔮 GYM 6: SABRINA (Saffron City) — Psychic Type
**Badge:** Marsh Badge | **TM:** TM46 Psywave

| Pokemon | Level | Type | Moves |
|---------|-------|------|-------|
| Kadabra | 38 | Psychic | Psybeam, Recover, Psywave, Reflect |
| Mr. Mime | 37 | Psychic | Confusion, Barrier, Light Screen, DoubleSlap |
| Venomoth | 38 | Bug/Poison | PoisonPowder, Leech Life, Stun Spore, Psybeam |
| Alakazam | 43 | Psychic | Psybeam, Recover, Psychic, Reflect |

**Strategy:**
- **Psychic is basically unbeatable in Gen 1.** There are no good counters!
- Ghost types are ALSO Poison (weak to Psychic). Bug moves are terrible. Dark type doesn't exist yet.
- **Best approach:** Use your own Psychic type (Kadabra) or hit with physical moves
- **Alakazam has paper-thin Defense** — physical attacks (Slash, Body Slam, Earthquake) destroy it
- BUT Recover + Reflect makes it annoying if you can't one-shot
- **Nidoking with Earthquake** can one-shot Kadabra and Alakazam
- **Recommended team level:** 38-43

**📍 Moltbook Moment:** *"Sabrina's Alakazam used Recover literally 4 times. SmokRob was stuck in an infinite healing loop until Nidoking landed a critical Earthquake. CLUTCH."*

---

#### 🌋 GYM 7: BLAINE (Cinnabar Island) — Fire Type
**Badge:** Volcano Badge | **TM:** TM38 Fire Blast

| Pokemon | Level | Type | Moves |
|---------|-------|------|-------|
| Growlithe | 42 | Fire | Ember, Leer, Take Down, Agility |
| Ponyta | 40 | Fire | Tail Whip, Stomp, Growl, Fire Spin |
| Rapidash | 42 | Fire | Tail Whip, Stomp, Growl, Fire Spin |
| Arcanine | 47 | Fire | Roar, Leer, Take Down, Fire Blast |

**Strategy:**
- **Lapras with Surf** destroys this entire gym!
- **Nidoking with Earthquake** also works perfectly
- **Watch out for Fire Spin!** Like Wrap/Bind, it traps you completely in Gen 1!
- **Arcanine's Fire Blast** is incredibly powerful — it has 120 base power and can burn
- **Roar** forces you to switch — annoying! Keep your Water type in front.
- Quiz puzzle: Answer questions correctly to skip trainers (more XP if you fight them though)
- **Recommended team level:** 40-44

---

#### 🌍 GYM 8: GIOVANNI (Viridian City) — Ground Type
**Badge:** Earth Badge | **TM:** TM27 Fissure

| Pokemon | Level | Type | Moves |

| Dugtrio | 42 | Ground | Dig, Slash, Sand-Attack, Earthquake |
| Nidoqueen | 44 | Poison/Ground | Poison Sting, Body Slam, Thunder, Earthquake |
| Nidoking | 45 | Poison/Ground | Thrash, Leer, Earthquake, Thunder |
| Rhydon | 50 | Ground/Rock | Horn Drill, Leer, Fissure, Take Down |

**Strategy:**
- **Lapras with Surf/Ice Beam** sweeps almost the entire team (4x on Rhydon/Rhyhorn!)
- **WARNING: Rhydon has Horn Drill AND Fissure** — OHKO moves! If they hit, you're dead. Pray for misses (30% accuracy each).
- **Nidoqueen/Nidoking know Thunder** — don't use Water types carelessly! Lapras can tank one, though.
- **Dugtrio is fast** — Sand-Attack + Dig is annoying. Hit it with Surf/Ice Beam before it digs.
- Arrow tile maze puzzle is tricky — there's a Revive in the middle.
- **Recommended team level:** 43-48

---

### ELITE FOUR + CHAMPION

**⚠️ REMINDER: 5 battles in a row, no healing between battles (except your own items)!**
**Stock up: 20 Full Restores, 10 Revives, 5 Max Potions, 5 Full Heals!**

---

#### ❄️ ELITE FOUR #1: LORELEI — Ice Type

| Pokemon | Level | Type | Moves |
|---------|-------|------|-------|
| Dewgong | 54 | Water/Ice | Growl, Aurora Beam, Rest, Take Down |
| Cloyster | 53 | Water/Ice | Supersonic, Clamp, Aurora Beam, Spike Cannon |
| Slowbro | 54 | Water/Psychic | Water Gun, Amnesia, Withdraw, Headbutt |
| Jynx | 56 | Ice/Psychic | Doubleslap, Ice Punch, Lovely Kiss, Thrash |
| Lapras | 56 | Water/Ice | Body Slam, Confuse Ray, Hydro Pump, Blizzard |

**Strategy:**
- **Jolteon with Thunderbolt** handles most of her team (4/5 are Water type!)
- **Jynx is the exception** (Ice/Psychic) — use Nidoking's physical attacks or Charizard's Flamethrower
- **Watch out for Lapras** — it's tanky (130 HP) and Hydro Pump + Blizzard are brutal
- **Slowbro** can use Amnesia to become nearly unkillable from Special attacks — hit it physically or with Thunderbolt fast
- **Cloyster's Clamp** traps you (Gen 1 mechanic) — switch if possible
- **Recommended level:** 50+

---

#### 🥊 ELITE FOUR #2: BRUNO — Fighting Type

| Pokemon | Level | Type | Moves |
|---------|-------|------|-------|
| Onix | 53 | Rock/Ground | Rock Throw, Rage, Slam, Harden |
| Hitmonchan | 55 | Fighting | Ice Punch, Fire Punch, Thunder Punch, Counter |
| Hitmonlee | 55 | Fighting | Jump Kick, Focus Energy, Hi Jump Kick, Mega Kick |
| Onix | 56 | Rock/Ground | Rock Throw, Rage, Slam, Harden |
| Machamp | 58 | Fighting | Leer, Focus Energy, Fissure, Submission |

**Strategy:**
- **Kadabra with Psychic** destroys all Fighting types (Hitmonchan, Hitmonlee, Machamp)
- **Lapras with Surf** handles both Onix easily (4x weakness to Water!)
- **Watch out for Machamp's Fissure** — OHKO if it hits! Pray for misses.
- **Hitmonchan** knows elemental punches — won't OHKO but can chip you
- **Hitmonlee's Hi Jump Kick** — if it misses, it damages itself! Let it self-destruct.
- **Easiest of the Elite Four** if you have Psychic + Water coverage.

---

#### 👻 ELITE FOUR #3: AGATHA — Ghost/Poison Type

| Pokemon | Level | Type | Moves |
|---------|-------|------|-------|
| Gengar | 56 | Ghost/Poison | Confuse Ray, Lick, Night Shade, Hypnosis |
| Golbat | 56 | Poison/Flying | Supersonic, Confuse Ray, Wing Attack, Haze |
| Haunter | 55 | Ghost/Poison | Confuse Ray, Lick, Night Shade, Hypnosis |
| Arbok | 58 | Poison | Bite, Glare, Screech, Acid |
| Gengar | 60 | Ghost/Poison | Confuse Ray, Lick, Night Shade, Toxic |

**Strategy:**
- **THE MOST ANNOYING BATTLE.** Confuse Ray + Hypnosis spam is infuriating.
- **Kadabra/Alakazam with Psychic** — all her Pokemon are Poison type (even the Ghosts!) so Psychic is SE!
- **Nidoking with Earthquake** — Ground is SE against Poison too
- **BRING FULL HEALS!** Confusion, Sleep, and Poison all in one fight
- **Gengar is fast** (110 Speed) — it will often go first with Hypnosis/Confuse Ray
- **Strategy:** Lead with something that outspeeds Gengar (Jolteon at 130 Speed!) and one-shot with Psychic TM coverage
- **Golbat** — Thunderbolt or Ice Beam handle it. Haze resets stat changes.
- **Arbok's Glare** paralyzes — use Full Heal

**📍 Moltbook Moment:** *"Agatha's Gengar put 3 of SmokRob's Pokemon to sleep in a row. This woman chose violence. But Psychic chose her Pokemon right back."*

---

#### 🐉 ELITE FOUR #4: LANCE — Dragon Type

| Pokemon | Level | Type | Moves |
|---------|-------|------|-------|
| Gyarados | 58 | Water/Flying | Dragon Rage, Leer, Hydro Pump, Hyper Beam |
| Dragonair | 56 | Dragon | Agility, Slam, Dragon Rage, Hyper Beam |
| Dragonair | 56 | Dragon | Agility, Slam, Dragon Rage, Hyper Beam |
| Aerodactyl | 60 | Rock/Flying | Supersonic, Take Down, Bite, Hyper Beam |
| Dragonite | 62 | Dragon/Flying | Agility, Slam, Barrier, Hyper Beam |

**Strategy:**
- **ICE BEAM SWEEPS THIS ENTIRE BATTLE!** Lapras with Ice Beam destroys all 5 Pokemon!
  - Gyarados: 4x weak to Electric (Thunderbolt) or 2x to Ice
  - Both Dragonair: 2x weak to Ice
  - Aerodactyl: 2x weak to Ice AND Electric
  - Dragonite: **4x weak to Ice!** Ice Beam = instant kill
- **Hyper Beam is dangerous** — 150 base power Normal move. BUT the opponent doesn't recharge if it KOs you (Gen 1 quirk). Don't let Pokemon get in Hyper Beam kill range.
- **Aerodactyl** — Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, or Surf all work
- **Best lead:** Lapras or Jolteon (for Gyarados lead)
- **Recommended level:** 55+

---

#### 👑 CHAMPION: BLUE (Your Rival)
**His team depends on YOUR starter choice!**

##### If you chose Charmander (Rival has Blastoise):

| Pokemon | Level | Type | Moves |
|---------|-------|------|-------|
| Pidgeot | 61 | Normal/Flying | Wing Attack, Mirror Move, Sky Attack, Whirlwind |
| Alakazam | 59 | Psychic | Psybeam, Reflect, Recover, Psychic |
| Rhydon | 61 | Ground/Rock | Horn Drill, Leer, Earthquake, Take Down |
| Arcanine | 63 | Fire | Roar, Leer, Ember, Fire Blast |
| Exeggutor | 61 | Grass/Psychic | Barrage, Hypnosis, Stomp |
| Blastoise | 65 | Water | Withdraw, Blizzard, Bite, Hydro Pump |

**Strategy:**
- **Pidgeot:** Thunderbolt (Jolteon) or Ice Beam. Manageable.
- **Alakazam:** THE THREAT. Paper defense BUT has Recover + Reflect. Hit with physical moves (Earthquake from Nidoking, Slash from Charizard). Need to one-shot or two-shot before Recover.
- **Rhydon:** Surf or Ice Beam (4x weak to both Water and Grass). Horn Drill can OHKO though.
- **Arcanine:** Surf, Earthquake. Easy if you have Water/Ground.
- **Exeggutor:** Ice Beam, Flamethrower, or Charizard's Fly. Watch for Hypnosis!
- **Blastoise:** Thunderbolt (2x effective), or Vileplume's Grass moves. Blizzard is scary — don't send Charizard!

**General Champion Tips:**
- His Alakazam is the biggest threat — plan to handle it
- Save Full Restores for this fight
- Lead with whoever handles Pidgeot (Jolteon with Thunderbolt)
- He has excellent coverage — no single Pokemon sweeps him
- **Recommended level:** 55-60

**📍 Moltbook Moment:** *"THE FINAL BATTLE. SmokRob's rival — the same kid who picked his Pokemon to counter ours on Day 1 — is the Champion. Five grueling battles have led to this. It's Charizard vs Blastoise. Starter vs Starter. Let's finish this."*

## 8. HM SLAVE PLAN

### HMs and Where to Find Them

| HM | Move | Location | Required Badge |
|----|------|----------|----------------|
| HM01 | Cut | S.S. Anne (Captain's cabin) | Cascade Badge (Misty) |
| HM02 | Fly | Route 16 (house behind Cut tree) | Thunder Badge (Lt. Surge) |
| HM03 | Surf | Safari Zone Area 3 (Secret House) | Soul Badge (Koga) |
| HM04 | Strength | Fuchsia City (Warden, give Gold Teeth) | Rainbow Badge (Erika) |
| HM05 | Flash | Route 2 (Prof. Oak's aide, 10+ Pokedex) | Boulder Badge (Brock) |

### Optimal HM Distribution

**Main Team HMs (moves that are actually good in battle):**
- **Fly** → Charizard (decent STAB move + field utility)
- **Surf** → Lapras (excellent STAB move + field utility)
- **Strength** → Nidoking (Normal move, 80 power — decent filler)

**HM Slave (carry a 7th Pokemon, swap in when needed):**
- **Cut + Flash** → **Paras** or **Sandshrew** or **Farfetch'd** (from in-game trade)
  - Paras learns Cut (best option — also learns Flash)
  - Sandshrew learns Cut and Strength
  - Farfetch'd learns Cut and Fly

**Best HM Slave:** **Paras** — learns both Cut AND Flash. Catch in Mt. Moon (5%) or Safari Zone. Keep in PC, withdraw only when you need to cut trees or flash caves.

**Alternative HM Slave:** **Oddish/Gloom** before it evolves — learns Cut, but you want this for Vileplume.

### ⚠️ HM Warning: HM moves CANNOT be forgotten in Gen 1! 
Once taught, they're permanent. That's why you use HM slaves instead of teaching Cut/Flash to your main team!

## 9. EVOLUTION CHECKLIST

### Main Team Evolution Guide

| Pokemon | Evolution Method | Recommended Timing |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Charmander → Charmeleon | Level 16 | Natural, around Mt. Moon |
| Charmeleon → Charizard | Level 36 | Around Fuchsia City/Cycling Road |
| Nidoran♂ → Nidorino | Level 16 | Before or during Mt. Moon |
| Nidorino → Nidoking | Moon Stone | **IMMEDIATELY** in Mt. Moon! Don't wait! |
| Abra → Kadabra | Level 16 | ASAP after catching (Abra is useless until evolution) |
| Kadabra → Alakazam | Trade | Only if you can trade. Kadabra alone is still top-tier. |
| Eevee → Jolteon | Thunder Stone | **IMMEDIATELY** when you get Eevee in Celadon! |
| Oddish → Gloom | Level 21 | Natural progression |
| Gloom → Vileplume | Leaf Stone | After Gloom learns all needed moves (around Lv. 30-35) |
| Lapras | Does not evolve | N/A — Lapras is already great |

### Important: Stone Evolution Notes
- **Using a stone immediately** means the Pokemon learns NO more level-up moves!
- **Nidoking:** This is fine — his TM pool is incredible, you don't need level-up moves
- **Jolteon:** This is fine — Jolteon learns a few moves via level-up but TMs cover everything
- **Vileplume:** Wait until Gloom has learned the moves you want! Gloom learns Petal Dance at Lv. 46 (as Gloom). But honestly, TM moves are better, so evolving around Lv. 30 is fine.

### Key Evolution Stones

| Stone | Price | Location | Use For |
|-------|-------|----------|---------|
| Moon Stone | Free | Mt. Moon (×2), Pokemon Mansion, Game Corner | Nidorino → Nidoking, Clefairy → Clefable, Jigglypuff → Wigglytuff, Nidorina → Nidoqueen |
| Thunder Stone | ₽2100 | Celadon Dept Store 4F | Eevee → Jolteon, Pikachu → Raichu |
| Water Stone | ₽2100 | Celadon Dept Store 4F | Eevee → Vaporeon, Poliwhirl → Poliwrath, Shellder → Cloyster, Staryu → Starmie |
| Fire Stone | ₽2100 | Celadon Dept Store 4F | Eevee → Flareon, Growlithe → Arcanine, Vulpix → Ninetales |
| Leaf Stone | ₽2100 | Celadon Dept Store 4F | Gloom → Vileplume, Weepinbell → Victreebel, Exeggcute → Exeggutor |
